/// Cursor is an editor built on VS Code, so its own OAuth token sits in the
/// SQLite database VS Code keeps global state in. The website, though,
/// authenticates with a **cookie** rather than a bearer header — and that
/// cookie is not stored anywhere to be found. It is *built*: the account id is
/// the tail of the token's own `sub` claim, and the cookie's value is that id
/// and the token joined by `::`.
///
/// Which is the whole reason this provider needs nothing from the user. The
/// obvious route to a site cookie is to go and read the browser's, which means
/// touching Safari's and Chrome's cookie stores for every domain they hold;
/// this asks the editor for its own login instead, exactly as the Claude Code
/// and Codex routes do.
///
/// Recent Cursor builds seal that row with Electron's safeStorage before they
/// write it (`cursor-safe-storage:v1:` plus a `v10` ciphertext). The key is the
/// same shape Chromium keeps for cookies — `Cursor Safe Storage` in the login
/// keychain — and is opened through `BrowserCookies.safeStorageKey`, the same
/// helper Claude Desktop and the browser routes already use. An older plaintext
/// JWT is still accepted as it stands.
///

/// or shown anywhere by Pulse.
